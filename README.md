# surely
## a humble chrome extension 

When enabled on a browser, ***surely*** draws attention to signals of certainty in a body of text.
The tool was inspired by "The 'Surely' Operator: A Mental Block” in Daniel C. Dennett's *Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking*:

> “Not always, not even most of the time, but often the word 'surely' is as good as a blinking light locating a weak point in the argument ... Why? Because it marks the very edge of what the author is actually sure about and hopes readers will also be sure about.”

By default, the extension flags uses of the word "surely" as well as
- obviously
- naturally
- of course
- incontrovertibly
- indupitably
- undoubtedly
- doubtless
- it goes without saying
- of course
- undeniably
- unmistakably
- without question

A user can deselect any of these words or phrases and add a limited number of custom strings to flag. They can also view a page's certainty-signaling score relative to ***surely***'s standardized scoring system and their personal ***surely*** history.
