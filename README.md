# surely
## a humble chrome extension 

When enabled on your browser, surely draws attention to signals of certainty in a body of text, signals that may make the certainty they're intended to communicate suspicious. 

> “Not always, not even most of the time, but often the word “surely” is as good as a blinking light locating a weak point in the argument ... Why? Because it marks the very edge of what the author is actually sure about and hopes readers will also be sure about.”

>> from Daniel C. Dennett, "The “Surely” Operator: A Mental Block” in *Intuition Pumps And Other Tools for Thinking.*
